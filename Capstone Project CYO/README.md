# Capstone Project - Fraud Detection

## Introduction

This project is a part of the edX - HarvardX Data Science course. According many available reports credit card frauds costed financial institutions a wooping 28 billion dollars just in 2018. Recent years we see a lot of development in cashless/digital transaction technologies for example ApplePay and GoogleWallet that will bring us to chaseless future very soon. Fraud transaction cost can put a lot of pressure on the financial institutions since it is not only loss due to the fraud itself, there is also cost associated with managing losses, cost of managing frustrated customers, cost of potential losing the business and many more. That is why many financial organizations are facing the challenge of building a successful fraud detection model which can flag fraudulent transactions with very small false-negative and false-positive results.

## Goal

The main purpose of this project was to create a machine learning model that would not only flag the suspicious/fraud transactions but also would identify changes in the patterns and adapt automatically to new fraud patterns.

## Data

The dataset for this project was obtain from Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/ paysim1) and was listed under recommended list of dataset for this project (https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/ml-friendly-public-datasets). Financial data is very important for many researches that try to build sufficient models for fraud detection and prevent any illegal financial activities. However this data is not publicly available for data scientists to work on since it can raise certain privacy concerns. The group of researchers generated a dataset called PaySim to tackle such a problem. PaySim simulates mobile money transactions based on a sample of private dataset extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. Therefore this data is perfect for building and evaluating the performance of fraud detection models
